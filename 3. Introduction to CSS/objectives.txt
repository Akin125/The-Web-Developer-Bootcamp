COLOURS
Hi Everyone,

The following lecture, "CSS Colors" has a segment where the colors flash across the screen rather quickly.

If you're prone to photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) then please avoid watching the screen from the 1 minute and 7 second mark until the 1 minute and 54 second mark in the video.

thanks,
Ian
